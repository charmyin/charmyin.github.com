## NetLimiter [(OriginSite)](http://www.technorms.com/36800/limit-bandwidth-usage-firefox-chrome-opera)

### NetLimiter – Limit Bandwidth Usage for Any Browser
To force Firefox to use only a certain amount of bandwidth which you specify, the go-to software to get this done is NetLimiter. This external program has been known to work even better than the now-defunct Firefox Throttle, as it can limit the bandwidth for any program, not just Firefox.

NetLimiter used to only offer free trials of the program, however a new freeware version of the software, NetLimiter 3 Monitor, is now available here.

After downloading the software, start it up so you can set up the bandwidth settings for Firefox.

To adjust the download and upload speeds for Firefox, find Firefox in the list of programs displayed. Highlight Firefox, then enter the various speeds you would like.

Also, right-click Firefox and select “Show info” to add additional bandwidth rules to Firefox. When the “Info View” window loads, click “Add Rule” to add a new bandwidth rule to the program. When adding a rule, you can put limits on firewalls as well as when you would like them to begin.
